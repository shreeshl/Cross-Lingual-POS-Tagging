Plots of top-50 hindi and english word vectors using PCA 
(reduced to 2 dimensions). These suggest that there we might not be able to 
obtain a linear transformation between the two word-vector spaces. 

That is probably why during training, even after many iterations the loss was not
reducing.

Future work? try a non-linear transformation a.k.a neural network.
